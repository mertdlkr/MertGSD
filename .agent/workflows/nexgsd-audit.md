# NexGsd Audit — Full Project Audit with Parallel Agents

Run a comprehensive project audit by spawning multiple specialist agents in parallel. Covers security, performance, mobile, SEO, accessibility, and brand consistency. Collects all reports into a unified AUDIT.md with prioritized findings and action items.

> **ANTI-HALLUCINATION PROTOCOL -- ACTIVE IN THIS WORKFLOW**
> Audit findings must be based on ACTUAL code analysis, not assumptions. Every finding MUST cite the exact file and line. Do NOT fabricate audit results to appear thorough. Do NOT claim "no issues" in a category without having actually checked. If a tool is unavailable, say so -- do not simulate its output.

## Arguments

The user may specify which audits to run or a scope:
- `/nexgsd-audit` -- run all audits
- `/nexgsd-audit security performance` -- run only specified audits
- `/nexgsd-audit src/` -- audit specific directory

If no argument provided, run all audit categories.

## Multi-Model Safeguard: Audit Integrity

**MANDATORY -- regardless of which AI model is running:**

```
AUDIT RULES:
1. Re-read STATE.md and ROADMAP.md -- understand the project
2. Every finding must cite EXACT file path and line number
3. Do NOT invent findings to appear thorough
4. Do NOT suppress findings to appear clean
5. If a tool is unavailable, report "NOT AUDITED" -- do NOT fake results
6. Severity must match real impact -- critical means real risk of exploit/outage

WARNING: A clean audit that missed real issues is worse than no audit.
Be thorough. Be honest. Cite evidence.
```

## Steps

### 1. Validate Project

**Actually read** (not recall) `.planning/ROADMAP.md` and `.planning/STATE.md`.

**If no `.planning/`:** "No NexGsd project found. Run /nexgsd-new-project first."

Determine audit scope:
```bash
# Understand the project structure
find . -maxdepth 2 -type f \( -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.jsx" -o -name "*.css" -o -name "*.html" \) | head -50

# Count source files
find . -type f \( -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.jsx" \) -not -path "*/node_modules/*" -not -path "*/.next/*" -not -path "*/dist/*" | wc -l

# Check for configuration files
ls package.json tsconfig.json next.config.* nuxt.config.* vite.config.* 2>/dev/null
```

```

### 2. Determine Audit Categories

Based on arguments and project type, select which audits to run:

| Category | Agent | Condition |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Security | security-auditor | Always |
| Performance | performance-tester | Always |
| Mobile | mobile-auditor | If project has UI (React, Vue, HTML) |
| SEO | seo-checker | If project has public pages |
| Accessibility | accessibility-tester | If project has UI |
| Brand | brand-reviewer | If brand guidelines exist in `.planning/` |

**If a category is not applicable:** Note it as "N/A -- [reason]" and skip.

### 3. Security Audit

Read and follow the agent instructions in `.agent/agents/nexgsd-security-auditor.md`.

The security auditor agent handles: secrets scanning, dependency vulnerabilities, code-level security review (injection, XSS, auth, CORS, etc.), and environment/config checks.

Record all findings with file, line, severity, and description.

### 4. Performance Audit

Read and follow the agent instructions in `.agent/agents/nexgsd-performance-tester.md`.

The performance tester agent handles: bundle analysis, code-level performance review (N+1 queries, memoization, memory leaks, lazy loading, etc.), and build configuration checks.

Record all findings with file, line, severity, and description.

### 5. Mobile Audit

**Skip if project has no UI.**

Read and follow the agent instructions in `.agent/agents/nexgsd-mobile-auditor.md`.

The mobile auditor agent handles: viewport meta tags, responsive breakpoints, touch target sizes, mobile navigation patterns, responsive images, and overall mobile usability.

Record all findings with file, line, severity, and description.

### 6. SEO Audit

**Skip if project has no public pages.**

Read and follow the agent instructions in `.agent/agents/nexgsd-seo-checker.md`.

The SEO checker agent handles: title tags, meta descriptions, Open Graph tags, canonical URLs, sitemap/robots.txt, alt text, semantic HTML, structured data, and SSR/SSG checks.

Record all findings with file, line, severity, and description.

### 7. Accessibility Audit

**Skip if project has no UI.**

Read and follow the agent instructions in `.agent/agents/nexgsd-accessibility-tester.md`.

The accessibility tester agent handles: WCAG 2.1 compliance, alt text, ARIA labels, form labels, color contrast, keyboard navigation, focus indicators, semantic HTML, and heading hierarchy.

Record all findings with file, line, severity, and description.

### 8. Brand Audit

**Skip if no brand guidelines exist.**

Read and follow the agent instructions in `.agent/agents/nexgsd-brand-reviewer.md`.

The brand reviewer agent handles: color palette consistency, typography, spacing/design system compliance, component usage, and copy tone/voice matching.

**If no brand guidelines:** Note "No brand guidelines found -- brand audit skipped."

### 9. Compile AUDIT.md

Collect all findings and prioritize by severity:

**Severity definitions:**
| Severity | Definition | Examples |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Critical | Immediate risk of exploit, data loss, or outage | SQL injection, exposed secrets, auth bypass |
| High | Significant issue affecting users or security | XSS, missing auth, N+1 queries on main pages |
| Medium | Should be fixed but not urgent | Missing alt text, hardcoded values, minor perf |
| Low | Nice to have, best practice | Code style, minor a11y, SEO improvements |

Create `.planning/AUDIT.md`:

```markdown
