# NexGsd Research Phase

Use this when the phase has unknown libraries, patterns, architecture, or domain risk.

## Steps

1. Read the target phase from `ROADMAP.md`.
2. Read `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `STATE.md`, and `CONTEXT.md` if present.
3. Research real sources before writing claims.
4. Write `.planning/phases/[NN]-[slug]/[NN]-RESEARCH.md` with:
   - implementation approach
   - libraries and tools
   - patterns to follow
   - pitfalls to avoid
   - references and confidence levels
5. Commit the research doc if planning docs are tracked.

## Completion

Recommend `/nexgsd-plan [N]` as the next command.
