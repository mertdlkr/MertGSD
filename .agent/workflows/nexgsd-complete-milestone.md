# NexGsd Complete Milestone

Close a milestone with a real archive, not a vague status flip.

## Steps

1. Verify milestone phases and plans are complete.
2. Review unresolved gaps or accepted tech debt.
3. Archive milestone roadmap and requirements into `.planning/milestones/`.
4. Update `PROJECT.md` to reflect the new product reality.
5. Update `ROADMAP.md` so shipped milestone details collapse into history.
6. Update `STATE.md` to the next working position.
7. Create a release tag if git tagging is in use.

## Completion

Return:

- archived files
- release version
- recommended next step: `/nexgsd-new-milestone`
